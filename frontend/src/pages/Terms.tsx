                provided to other customers. You acknowledge that there are numerous limitations that apply 
                with respect to AI-generated suggestions, including that (i) Suggestions may contain errors 
                or incomplete information, (ii) AI models may produce outdated or inaccurate tender status 
                information, (iii) procurement data may change after analysis, (iv) tender opportunities 
                may have specific requirements not captured in our analysis, and (v) success in procurement 
                depends on many factors beyond our Service. You agree that you are responsible for evaluating, 
                and bearing all risks associated with, the use of any Suggestions.
